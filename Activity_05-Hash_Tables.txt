# Activity #05: Hash Tables

# Create two empty hash tables with the following names:
#  -employee1
#  -employee2

<#
#Creating the emtpy hash table of employee1
$employee1 = [ordered]@{}

## '[ordered]' keeps the hash table key-values in the same order as they are defined
## when the hash table is declared/as more key-values are added

# Adding the keys and values for employee1
$employee1.First = "Mary"
$employee1["Last"] = "Hopper"
$employee1.ID = "001"
$employee1["Job"] = "Software Developer"

# Add keys and values for employee2

$employee2 = [ordered]@{ First = "John" ; Last = "Williams" ; ID = "002" ; Job = "Web Developer" }
#>

# Now add a new key called Username which holds a contraction of the employeeâ€™s 
# first initial then last name then ID. (i.e. mhopper001).

<#
$employee1.Username = "mhopper001"
$employee2["Username"] = "jwilliams002"

# Mary got promoted to "Software Lead" so the job key for Mary needs to be 
# changed to "Software Lead"

<#
$employee1.Job = "Software Lead"

# Create a new hash table called "employee3" that contains the following values
# with the respective keys.

<#
# Create employee3 
$employee3 = [ordered]@{}

# Add keys and values for employee3
$employee3.First = "Alex"
$employee3["Last"] = "Moran"
$employee3.add("ID","003")
$employee3.Username = "amoran003"
$employee3["Job"] = "Software Developer"
#>

# Add a new key called "Status" that holds the values:

<#
$employee1.Status = "Management"
$employee2["Status"] = "Intermediate"
$employee3.Status = "Entry Level"
