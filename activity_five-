#Get-Service | format-table * --> gets more info out of a command
#get-service | format-list * --> this is another one that gets more info
#Get-Service BTAGService| format-list *
#Get-service | Get-Member --> similar to the one below this. but different info kinda.
#Get-Member -inputObject Get-Service --> simular to the one above it, but different info kinda.
#(get-service bfe).starttype --> gets the starttype of a service called BFE, base filtering engine. It manages firewall and Internet Protocol security (IPsec) policies and implements user mode filtering. 
#(get-service bfe).stop() --> stops a service called BFE
#write-host pushes right to the screen
#write-output allows other commands to adjust the info like 'sort'
#
#use 'Get-Command -verb format' to find the ways to format and squeeze out more information on the commands used

#get-service | sort-object -Property  status --> sorts objects off of their running or stopped status
#get-service | group-object -Property  status --> displays a number of running and stopped services

#Get-Service | Where-Object { $_.status -eq "Running"} --> this displays only the Running services! :3
#hehehehehehe
#get-process | select-object -first 10 --> basicly the head command but with more words. >:3

#get-process | where-object processname -ne "Idle" | sort-object starttime | select-object -last 10 | Format-Table processname, starttime
# This one ^^^^^^ looks for process start time

#get-unique --> requires a sort before it works. finds all unique char. no duplicates
