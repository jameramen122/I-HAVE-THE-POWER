powershell is not an exe, it is a dll.

on new machines, make sure to run update-help -force -Erroraction (followed by one of 6 choses)

there is also get-help. (man is an Ailias)

get-service is very good too.

get-childitem  -path C:\ -recurse -filter *.pf -name
gci -rec C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc -filt *.pf -na --> the shorter names are accepted by powershell so long as the shorthand actually solo's out the remaining cmd. rec is recurse while re is ReadOnly


#switch paramiters
#they are boolians:
#-on
#--or off
#---nothing else. these are off unless made otherwise.
-recurse --> this is a switch paramiter.

positional paramiters
optional to the call, they look at strings,
get-childitem C:\ -recurse -filter *.pf -name --> runs the same as the other up there
get-childitem -recurse -filter *.pf -name C:\ --> same
get-childitem -recurse -filter *.pf C:\ -name --> this also prints the same things to the scren.

get-service -name power,Dnscache
